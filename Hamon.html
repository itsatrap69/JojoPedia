    <title>Power Systems: Hamon</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hamon:</h1>
    <p>Hamon, literally meaning Ripple, is the power to channel one’s energy into sun waves. Through controlled breathing
        and thorough training a trainee can produce energy that ripples through their body or other objects to mimic the
        power of the sun. It is said that liquids conduct hamon better than any other object. They can output this energy
        through attacks, techniques or imbue it into weapons and objects, it has also been used to heal before.
        It is the main power system of the protagonists in Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency and used briefly by Joseph
        Joestar in Stardust Crusaders, but it was mainly disregarded after the first two parts.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Overview: </h1>
    Hamon was first shown in Chapter 18 of Jojo’s Bizzare Adventures: Phantom Blood, used by William Anthonio Zeppeli under
    the alias “Baron”.
    Using his pinky he pierced Jonathan’s diaphragm forcing him to produce hamon energy healing his arm in the process,
    proceeding to explain that “Sendo” is an art from the east that channels Hamon energy into ripples spreading through the
    body by breathing in a special way. Zeppeli notices an innate talent for hamon in Jojo and proceeds to train him,
    teaching him the ins and outs of hamon energy. During this training period Zeppeli explains that anyone can breathe
    instinctively, the difference between a normal person and a hamon user is learning how to control the rhythm of their
    breathing, not letting it waver under any circumstance. Creating the energy of the sun using your own blood flow and
    oxygen, that is the secret of hamon.More and more applications of hamon have been shown as the parts proceeded, in Battle Tendency Caesar Zeppeli used
    his hamon to control people while Joseph Joestar used his to make people pass out, similar to over exposure in the sun.
    A common theme in attacks using hamon is the wound being very hot, in some cases melting body parts.
    Some unique characteristics of training the ripple were shown in Parts 1 and 2. Master Tonpetty, of the Tibetan monks
    who taught William Zeppeli had acquired the power of clairvoyance and Lisa Lisa used the hamon energy to preserve her
    youth throughout the years.
    <br> The only noticeable weaknesses of hamon is distributing the flow of oxygen in the user, shown by Dio in Part 1
    where he froze Jonathan’s allies and pierced his trachea and Wamuu in Part 2 exclaiming that Caesar was unable to fight
    anymore due to excessive blood loss.

    <h1>Training Regime: </h1>
    As breathing is a key part of harnessing hamon energy all of its users have been shown to undergo vigorous cardio and
    aerobic activities. Beyond the basic rhythm training hamon masters have procured unique training regimes to pass on to
    their students. Will. A. Zeppeli made Jonathan learn Sendo, the martial art that uses hamon while also training in
    nature to further connect to the power bestowed upon Earth by the Sun.
    <br>
    Caesar and Joseph underwent the “Pillar of Hell”, a 24 meter pillar with a slippery surface that is in the center of a
    pit. Implemented into the pillar is a system that sends oil down its surface continuously and traps embedded into the
    walls. They were both thrown down the pit and Lisa Lisa explained that the power of hamon is the only way to climb up,
    forcing them into a life or death situation to master their control over the ripple.
    Special breathing masks were also used, specifically by Joseph Joestar who had to master hamon in a short time span.

    <h1>Feats: </h1>
    Hamon users all have come up with unique ways to channel the ripple, beyond basic attacks. Such as the following.
    <ul>
        <li>Forced breathing, demonstrated by Will A. Zeppeli.</li>
        <li>Zoom punch, dislocating your joints to elongate your arm and attack your target.</li>
        <li>Hamon overdrive, channeling your ripple into a spiral and sending it through an object to attack whatever is on the other side.</li>
        <li>Elemental attacks such as scarlet and turquoise overdrive, creating flames or sending water flying.</li>
        <li>Sunlight Yellow overdrive, a technique channeling all your hamon into an all out attack.</li>
        <li>Bubble launcher and cutter, Caesar Zeppeli used bubbles charged with hamon to send out attacks.</li>
    </ul>
